#US Elections Analysis

###Description

The goal of this project was to examine the historical vote for the US President from 1960 through 2020 at a national, state, and county level.   Voting data was collected from multiple Github repositories.  Socioeconomic data was collected from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  The following bullets list out my main objectives of this project:

- Understand how the US vote for President has changed over time
- Understand the characteristics of counties that vote similarly
- Predict the results of the 2024 US Presidential election at a county level
